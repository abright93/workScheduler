# workScheduler

For this homework assignment, I created a scheduler that allows a user to document whatever tasks you may need done during the work day. The gray time blocks represent time periods that have already passed, a red time block will indicate present time, and green time blocks are for future times. The user is able to add their tasks to the scheduler, and when the page refreshes, their changes will be saved and the current time will be up to date.
